# About Me

Here is **Sihao Liu (刘思颢)**.( You can call me Touma)

I am a junior student major in the Artificial Intelligence([**School of Future Technology**](https://future.hit.edu.cn/)), [**Harbin Institute of Technology**](http://www.hit.edu.cn/) in China, supervised by Prof. [**Xiaopeng Fan**](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/xiaopengfan) and Prof. [**Mingyi Liu**](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/lmy).

## Research Interests

My main interest is in the practical problems of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and innovative technologies related to **Extended Reality (XR)**. I believe that deep learning can bring technological innovation to the rapid development of various industries in the future and XR technology will be the cornerstone of human life in the future. Based on this, I have studied related technologies including **Graph neural network, Service Recommendation, 3D Reconstruction and Virtual Reality**. I am committed to contributing to meaningful causes and benefits society by developing practical innovative solutions that combine deep learning techniques.

Key Word: **Deep Learning**, **Continual Learning**, **LLM**, **GNN**, **XR**

<!-- My research interests are **Explainable AI (XAI)** and **Privacy-preserving AI**. Specifically, my research goal is to build faithful XAI systems which are easily understood by users and are robust in various environments (e.g. **XAI4LLM, XAI4NLP, XAI4MM, XAI4CV, XAI4Security** and so on). I am also interested in applying the XAI to real-world scenarios (e.g. optical systems, recommender systems, and traffic forecasting etc.). At the same time, I am also very interested in the research of AI in the field of **astronomy, environmental science, materials and medicine**. -->

<!-- Prior to this, I have also been exposed to bioinformatics, multimodal sentiment analysis, domain generalization and other research areas. -->

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *liusihao[at]stu[dot]hit[dot]edu[dot]cn*.
