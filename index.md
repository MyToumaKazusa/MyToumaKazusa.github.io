# About Me

Here is **Sihao Liu (刘思颢)**. (You can call me Touma)

I am a junior student major in the Artificial Intelligence([**School of Future Technology**](https://future.hit.edu.cn/)), [**Harbin Institute of Technology**](http://www.hit.edu.cn/) in China, supervised by Prof. [**Xiaopeng Fan**](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/xiaopengfan) and Prof. [**Mingyi Liu**](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/lmy).

## Research Interests

Currently, my research interests are primarily focused on **Artificial Intelligence**. My research experience includes **Continual Learning, Large Language Models, 3D Reconstruction, Graph Neural Networks, and Recommendation**. I believe AI (though perhaps not limited to deep learning, xD) will be the most transformative technology of the 21st century, bringing revolutionary optimizations and creative breakthroughs to various industries. I am committed to advancing AI technologies and driving meaningful innovations for society. When I was 18, I believed that **XR** (Extended Reality) would be a crucial technology for the next stage of society———and I still do, though now from a more AI-centric perspective, xD. By the way, I self-taught many hardware technologies and built a pair of augmented reality glasses.

I have a wide range of research interests in the field of AI. I believe exploring various areas before starting a PhD is both fascinating and challenging. This means I am willing to continuously learn about different directions, as long as they are interesting!

Key Word: **Deep Learning**, **Continual Learning**, **LLM**, **GNN**, **XR**

<!-- My research interests are **Explainable AI (XAI)** and **Privacy-preserving AI**. Specifically, my research goal is to build faithful XAI systems which are easily understood by users and are robust in various environments (e.g. **XAI4LLM, XAI4NLP, XAI4MM, XAI4CV, XAI4Security** and so on). I am also interested in applying the XAI to real-world scenarios (e.g. optical systems, recommender systems, and traffic forecasting etc.). At the same time, I am also very interested in the research of AI in the field of **astronomy, environmental science, materials and medicine**. -->

<!-- Prior to this, I have also been exposed to bioinformatics, multimodal sentiment analysis, domain generalization and other research areas. -->

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *lshtoumakazusa[at]163[dot]com*.
